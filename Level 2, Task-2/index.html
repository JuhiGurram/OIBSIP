        <p><span>This page is the tribute to the bravest Indian Army!</span><br>
            Miles away from the military camp, a mother’s heart yearns to catch a glimpse of her son… Miles away from the terror-prone border, an affectionate wife recites prayers for the safe homecoming of her husband…
            
            Somewhere along the deserted Indian border, stands a courageous soldier who sacrifices his sleep, to ensure that citizens of our nation don’t lose their sleep! Somewhere along the deserted border, stands a sturdy soldier whose tender heart beats for our nation.
            
            As a young school student, Late Major Mukund Varadarajan was content with average marks but he always had a laser-like focus to serve the army someday.
            While he spent his childhood playing endlessly, he lived his adulthood serving the nation selflessly!
            A pinch of pain is felt as he spent more time with his friends but after joining the army he confessed to his father-“ Now I realize the value of family. ”
            On 25 April 2014, Our nation lost Major Mukund Varadarajan, an irreplaceable hero. The lion-hearted man led an illustrious career. In fact, the 31-year old, successfully encountered and shot the terrorists but fatally succumbed to severe injuries.
